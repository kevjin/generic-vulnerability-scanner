# Generic Vulnerability Scanner
An automated vulnerability scanning tool for any code repository.

While there are a number of existing tools out there that can scan a specific codebase (ex. Python, React.js, C#, .NET), there isn't a single solution that can work for all of them. The purpose of this tool, is to be an easily extendable solution, for any type of codebase.

### Structure:
One of the key features of this tool is how it's structured. This project is divided up into two main pieces:
- The core framework `/framework`
- Test modules `/vulnerability_modules`

The purpose of the core framework is to call each test module, passing in a file, its contents, and other helpful information, to determine if there is a vulnerability.
Each test module represents a single vulnerability to look for. By adding a test module to `/vulnerability_modules`, the core framework can automatically find it and call it when performing the vulnerability scan.

### Set Up:
1. Navigate to the root directory of your project (that you want to set up vulnerability scanning).
2. Clone this repository with the following command:
```
git clone https://github.com/kevjin/generic-vulnerability-scanner
```
3. Run the command:
```
python vulnerability_tool/run_tool.py
```

### Git Integration:
The vulnerability tool supports git integration, so every time a developer makes a `git commit`, the tool will automatically perform a scan on any changed files.
#### 2-Step Set up:
1. Copy the file `precommit_hook/pre-commit.py` into `.git/hooks/`. Since `.git/` is a hidden directory, you may need to configure your IDE to show hidden files.
2. Rename the copied `pre-commit.py` file to `pre-commit`.

### DEBUG Mode:
By default, `DEBUG` mode is set to true. When a vulnerability scan is run, any passed tests are shown as well. It may be cleaner to set `DEBUG=False` in `framework/tool.py`.
