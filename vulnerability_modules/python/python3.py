TEST_NAME = "Python 2 (Deprecated)"
TEST_DESCRIPTION = """
This test checks that Python 3 is used over earlier versions (ex. Python 2.7).
Python 2 support officially ends on January 1st, 2020. Other open source
projects will likely stop supporting Python 2 as well. To prevent security
vulnerabilities, it is best to upgrade to Python 3, where newly discovered
vulnerabilities are quickly patched.
